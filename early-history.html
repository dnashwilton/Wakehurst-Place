    <h1>Early history of Wakehurst</h1>
    <section class="inner">
    <h2>Early Civilisation</h2>
    
    <h3>Mesolithic Period</h3>
        <p>Evidence shows that occupation occurred around Wakehurst as flint tools were discovered in Tilgate Wood, next to Westwood Lake, in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesolithic" target="_blank">Mesolithic Period</a> (10,000 – 8,000 BC).
        Rock shelters were found near the flint tools, and these shelters would provide a safe base to hunt from. </p> 
    <h3>Bronze Period </h3>
        <p>Ditches and pits, thought to produce pottery, were discovered in the area of the Millennium Seed Bank. These ditches and pits are from the Bronze Age (3,300 – 1,200 BC).</p>
    <h3>Roman Period</h3>       
        <p>In 43AD, after the Romans invaded Britain, a military road from London was built, and that road remains are now under the car park at Wakehurst.</p>
        <p>From the early stages of history and for thousands of years, the landscape around Wakehurst was a backdrop to the early survival of human civilisation as it developed and began a new way of life.
