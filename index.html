        <h2>The woods at Wakehurst</h2>
        <p>The woodlands at Wakehurst have many specimens of temperate trees from all over the world with carpets of wild flowers providing all around the year contrasts of colour. The trees have been grouped according to where they would grow naturally. This is known as a phytogeographic planting system. In the heart of Sussex, you can travel the world and see the different trees.</p>
