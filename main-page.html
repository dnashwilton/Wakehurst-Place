    <h1>Today at Wakehurst</h1>
    <p id ="poem"><span>There is a poem that can be applied to Wakehurst:</span><br>
        <em>Winter is all bare branched, wild heather and stormy skies.<br>
        Spring, a purple haze of bluebells and a riot of rhododendrons.<br>
        Summer means tumbling rose petals, bumbling bees and birdcalls.<br>
        Autumn is spectacular foliage, rushing watercourses and the call of crows.</em></p>
        <p>Wakehurst, also known as Wakehurst Place, is located in West Sussex, north of Ardingly, in the High Weald (grid reference: <a href="https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?pagename=Wakehurst_Place&params=51.06720_N_0.08894_W_region:GB_source:enwiki-osgb36(TQ340315)_type:landmark">TQ340315,</a> <a href="https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?pagename=Wakehurst_Place&params=51.066475005004_N_0.089679164159818_W_region:GB">OS Grid Reference)</a>. Although the National Trust owns it, it is managed and used by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, also known as Kew Gardens. The Royal Botanic Gardens is in Kew, which is in London.</p>
        <p>Wakehurst has gardens covering 500 acres, including walled and water gardens, woodland and wetland conservation areas and a mansion built in 1590.</p>
        <p>The Royal Botanic Garden, Kew, also known as RBG, Kew has leased the gardens since 1965. A new building called the Millennium Seed Back project and the creation of the Loder Valley and the Francis Rose Natural Reserves have been achieved since then.</p>

        <p>Wakehurst is listed as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listed_building#England_and_Wales" target="_blank">Grade I</a> on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Heritage_List_for_England">National Heritage List for England</a>, and the gardens are listed as Grade II on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_of_Historic_Parks_and_Gardens_of_special_historic_interest_in_England">Register of Historic Parks and Gardens</a> . Wakehurst has stables listed as Grade II, and the South Lodge and gateway are listed as Grade II.</p>
        <p>At 11.30 every day, you can learn about Wakehurst and its gardens from Wakehurst’s guides, who give guided walking tours. If you want to wander the gardens, there are plenty of information boards and signpost so visitors can find their way around them.</p>
        <p>Some areas at Wakehurst need a permit and a key code to enter, which can be obtained before you leave the Visitor Centre.</p>
        <p>Every season, you can enjoy talks, trails and tours that capture the nature of Wakehurst from dawn to dusk.</p>

        <p>The gardens are a photographer’s dream, and everywhere visitors go in the gardens, there is something to photograph. Whether it is plants, views or reflections on the water of ponds, or the waterfalls’ splashing, there is something to see.</p> 
        <p>As the visitors walk around the gardens, they will find some of the paths are steep and uneven, but around the gardens, bushes and water gardens, there are alternative routes which make the less mobile visitors feel that they can enjoy the gardens.</p>
        <p>The gardens use a system known as a ‘phytogeographic planting system. This system groups species to where they would be found in the world.</p>
        <p>In Bethlehem Wood, the British birches, with their silvery bark, blend with bluebells and wildflowers.</p>

        <p>The restoration of a local meadow with rich Wealden grasslands is in Bloomers Valley.</p>
        <p>Australasian and South American tree species with native English wildflowers carpeting the floor are planted in Coates Wood.</p>
        <p>Inspired by the Himalayas, the area of the Westwood Valley and the lake has forests of rhododendrons, limes, magnolias, maples, alders, oaks, birches, rowan trees and conifers.</p>
        <p>With an oasis of mini-cascades, streams and still ponds, the Water Gardens are a peaceful retreat from the visitors that can descend on Wakehurst at certain times of the year.</p>
        <p>From North America, the redwood, sweet gum and hickory trees are in Horswood Wood.</p>
        <p>There is an American Prairie area near the walled gardens, and it is signposted.</p>
        <!-- Wakehurst Wetland-->
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Gqc9ljP.jpg" width="200" class="picture-left"/> 
        <p>If you like to wander through the wetland, there are boardwalks, in the Rock Garden, twisted tree roots and the Loder Valley which covers 150 acres (607m2) and teeming with wildlife all year round.</p>
        <p>The heart of Wakehurst is preserving plants for future generations. Scientists preserve, store, and regenerate plant species worldwide inside the Millennium Seed Bank.</p>
        <p>Lastly, all the various parts of the gardens are the planter’s insurance policy by studying, planting and re-establishing species vital to life on earth.</p>
